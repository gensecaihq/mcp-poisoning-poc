# Technical Analysis: MCP Security Architecture

## GenSecAI Deep Dive

A comprehensive technical analysis by [GenSecAI](https://gensecai.org) of MCP security vulnerabilities.

## Executive Summary

This analysis by GenSecAI's research team examines the fundamental security flaws in the Model Context Protocol.

## Current Architecture

### Protocol Overview
- Client-server model
- JSON-RPC communication
- Trust-based security

### Security Model Failures
1. No verification of tool descriptions
2. Implicit trust in server content
3. No isolation between tools

## GenSecAI Proposed Solutions

### 1. Cryptographic Layer
- Digital signatures for tools
- Certificate-based trust
- Blockchain verification

### 2. Capability-Based Security
- Fine-grained permissions
- Sandboxed execution
- Audit trails

### 3. Community Standards
- GenSecAI certification program
- Security best practices
- Open-source tools

## Future Research

GenSecAI is actively researching:
- Advanced detection methods
- AI-powered defense systems
- Protocol enhancements
